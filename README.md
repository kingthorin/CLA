# ZAP Contributor License Agreement Files

This repo contains the [ZAP](https://github.com/zaproxy/zaproxy/) Contributor License Agreement files.

For more details see the [ZAP Contributor License Agreement](https://www.zaproxy.org/blog/2024-10-23-zap-contributor-license-agreement/) blog post.

Once https://github.com/zaproxy/zaproxy/pull/8317 has been merged in the main ZAP repo:

* You will be prompted to sign the CLA when you submit your first ZAP PR.
* If you agree to the CLA then your GitHub username will be recorded in this repo.
* The [ZAPCLA](ZAPCLA.md) file will be removed from this repo as the one in [zaproxy](https://github.com/zaproxy/zaproxy/) will be the definitive version.

If you would like to agree to the ZAP CLA but do not have a PR ready to submit to the ZAP repos then you can submit a dummy one to this repo - we don't need the PR to be merged so can then just close it.
